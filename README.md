# How to Create a Stickman Running Game with Unity
## Overview
This game was made with [Unity](https://unity.com) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to program it. Unity is scripted in [C#](https://unity.com/how-to/programming-unity).
## Unity Setup
### Unity Code
When you first create your script for your sprite, there will already be two methods loaded in. ```Start()``` is called at the very beginning before the first frame. ```Update``` is called once per frame.
```
using UnityEngine;

public class StickmanScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {

    }

    void Update()
    {

    }
}
```
