# How to Create a Stickman Running Game with Unity
## Overview
This game was made with [Unity](https://unity.com) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to program it. Unity is scripted in [C#](https://unity.com/how-to/programming-unity).
## Unity Setup

```
using UnityEngine;

    public float jumpStrength;
    void Start()
