## Overview
Stickman Run is a simple yet addictive 2D endless runner game where you control a stickman who must jump over ground-level obstacles and dodge floating boxes.

- Objective: Survive as long as possible and increase your score by avoiding obstacles.
- Controls: Press Space or Up Arrow to jump, and Down Arrow to fall faster.
- Dynamic Difficulty: Obstacles gradually move faster over time to challenge the player.
- Scoring: Every obstacle that leaves the screen without hitting the stickman adds 1 point.
- Game Over: Colliding with the side of a box ends the game and displays the Game Over screen.

## Prerequisites
- Unity (latest version)
- Basic knowledge of C#
- A computer with Windows/Mac

## Unity Setup
**1.** Open **Unity Hub**, go to **Installs**, select your Unity version, and **add Visual Studio Code as a module**.

### Sprite Setup
Sprites are the **visual representations of game objects**. For this game, we need:
- **Stickman character**
- **Ground (floor)**
- **Box (obstacle)**

**1.** Import Sprites
 - **Download or create your own** sprites.
 - **Import them into Unity**:  
   - Go to **Assets ‚Üí Import New Asset**  
   - Select the sprite images.

**2.** Create GameObjects
   - Create **three GameObjects**:
     - **Stickman**
     - **Ground**
     - **Box (obstacle)**
   - Attach a **Sprite Renderer** component to each.
     - Drag the correct sprite into the **Sprite Renderer**.
  
**3.** Add Physics Components
For each GameObject:
   - Add **Rigidbody2D** (for physics-based movement)
   - Add **BoxCollider2D** (for collision detection)

### Unity Layout
Here, you will find everything you need to use in order to create the stickman running game. The **Hierarchy** is where your game objects will be created and used, and the **Inspector** is where you will attach components to it.

### Unity Scripting (C#)
Scripts are instructions for your game objects to follow, they are attached as a component the same way as you attached **"Sprite Renderer"** and **"Ridgidbody2D"**. When you first create your script for your sprite, there will be two methods loaded in. ```Start()``` is called at the very beginning before the first frame. ```Update()``` is called once per frame.
```
using UnityEngine;

public class StickmanScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {

    }

    void Update()
    {

    }
}
```

## Visual Studio Code
There are 5 classes needed for this game to function properly, stickman's functions, box movements, box spawning, box deletion, and a logic script.

### StickManScript.cs
The **StickmanScript.cs** controls the **player's movement**, specifically jumping and falling, while also handling **collisions** with the ground and obstacles. The script ensures that:
- The **Stickman can jump** when touching the ground.
- The **Stickman falls faster** when pressing the **Down Arrow**.
- The **game ends** when the Stickman **collides with the left side of an obstacle**.

#### Step 1) Declaring Variables
```
using UnityEngine;

public class StickmanScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Rigidbody2D myRidgidbody;
    public float jumpStrength;
    public float downStrength;
    private bool isGrounded;
    private LogicScript logic;
```
- ```Rigidbody2D myRidgidbody;``` ‚Üí Stores the Rigidbody2D component, allowing Unity's physics engine to handle movement.
- ```float jumpStrength;``` ‚Üí Controls how high the Stickman jumps.
- ```float downStrength;``` ‚Üí Controls how fast the Stickman falls when the Down Arrow is pressed.
- ```bool isGrounded;``` ‚Üí Keeps track of whether the Stickman is on the ground (prevents double jumps).
- ```LogicScript logic;``` ‚Üí Reference to the LogicScript for triggering the Game Over screen.

#### Step 2) Initialize Variables (```Start()```Method)
```
    void Start()
    {
        isGrounded = false;

        // Find Logic Manager
        GameObject logicManager = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Logic");
        if (logicManager != null)
        {
            logic = logicManager.GetComponent<LogicScript>();
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("‚ùå ERROR: Logic Manager not found! Make sure it has the tag 'Logic'.");
        }
    }
```
- The ```sGrounded``` variable is initialized as false, meaning the Stickman starts in the air.
- ```GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Logic")``` searches for a GameObject tagged as "Logic" in the scene.
- If found, it gets the ```LogicScript``` component so we can later call ```logic.gameOver()``` to end the game.
- If not found, an error message is displayed in the Unity Console.

#### Step 3) Handling Player Input (```Update()``` Method)
```
    void Update()
    {
        if (isGrounded && (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) || Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.UpArrow)))
        {
            myRidgidbody.linearVelocity = Vector2.up * jumpStrength;
            isGrounded = false; // Prevent double jumps
        }

        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.DownArrow))
        {
            myRidgidbody.linearVelocity = Vector2.down * downStrength;
        }
    }
```
- The Stickman can only jump when ```isGrounded == true```.
- Pressing ```Space``` or ```Up Arrow``` applies an upward force (```Vector2.up * jumpStrength```), making the Stickman jump.
- After jumping, ```isGrounded``` is set to ```false``` to prevent multiple jumps in mid-air.
- Pressing ```Down Arrow``` applies a downward force (```Vector2.down * downStrength```), making the Stickman fall faster.

#### Step 4) Collision Handling (```OnCollisionEnter2D()``` Method)
```
    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground") || collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Box"))
        {
            isGrounded = true;
        }

        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Box")) // Ensure it's a Box
        {
            Debug.Log("‚úÖ Stickman collided with a Box!");

            ContactPoint2D[] contactPoints = new ContactPoint2D[collision.contactCount];
            collision.GetContacts(contactPoints);

            foreach (ContactPoint2D contact in contactPoints)
            {
                Debug.Log("üëâ Contact Normal: " + contact.normal);

                if (contact.normal.x < -0.5f) // Left side hit detected
                {
                    Debug.Log("‚ùå Game Over! Stickman hit the left side of the Box.");
                    logic.gameOver(); // Trigger Game Over
                    Time.timeScale = 0f; // Pause game
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
- If the Stickman lands on the ground (```"Ground"```) or a Box (```"Box"```), it is considered grounded (```isGrounded = true```).
- If the Stickman collides with a Box, it checks where the collision occurred.
- ```collision.GetContacts(contactPoints);``` retrieves all contact points of the collision.
- ```contact.normal.x < -0.5f```
  - This means the Stickman hit the left side of the Box.
  - If ```true```, it triggers Game Over (```logic.gameOver();```) and pauses the game (```Time.timeScale = 0f;```).

#### Step 5) Handling Exit Collisions (```OnCollisionExit2D()``` Method)
```
    void OnCollisionExit2D(Collision2D collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground"))
        {
            isGrounded = false;
        }
    }
}
```
- If the Stickman leaves the ground (```"Ground"```), isGrounded is set to ```false```.
- This prevents the player from double jumping.

### FloatBoxMoveScript.cs
The **FloatBoxMoveScript.cs** controls the **movement of floating obstacles** in the Stickman Running Game. This script:
- **Moves obstacles from right to left** across the screen.
- **Gradually increases movement speed** over time, making the game more challenging.
- **Destroys the obstacle** when it moves off-screen.
- **Increases the player's score** when an obstacle is successfully avoided.

#### Step 1) Declaring Variables
```
using UnityEngine;

public class FloatBoxMoveScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveSpeed = 5f;
    public float speedIncrease = 0.2f;
    public float maxSpeed = 10f;
    private LogicScript logicScript;
```
- ```float moveSpeed;``` ‚Üí Controls the speed at which the box moves to the left.
- ```float speedIncrease;``` ‚Üí Determines how much the speed increases over time.
- ```float maxSpeed;``` ‚Üí Sets a cap on the movement speed to prevent it from becoming too fast.
- ```LogicScript logicScript;``` ‚Üí Reference to ```LogicScript```, used to increase the player's score when an obstacle is successfully avoided.

#### Step 2) Initializing the Script (```Start()``` Method)
```
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("‚úÖ FloatBoxMoveScript has started!");
        logicScript = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<LogicScript>();

        if (logicScript == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("‚ùå ERROR: LogicScript NOT found! Make sure 'Logic Manager' is in the scene.");
        }
    }
```
- ```Debug.Log("‚úÖ FloatBoxMoveScript has started!")```; ‚Üí Displays a message in the Unity Console to confirm that the script has started.
- ```logicScript = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<LogicScript>();```
  - Finds the Logic Manager in the scene and assigns it to ```logicScript```.
  - This allows the script to update the player's score when a box is destroyed.
- If ```LogicScript``` is not found, an error message is logged.

#### Step 3) Moving the Obstacle (```Update()``` Method)
```
    void Update()
    {
        moveSpeed = Mathf.Min(moveSpeed + speedIncrease * Time.deltaTime, maxSpeed);
        transform.position += Vector3.left * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;

        if (transform.position.x < -10f)
        {
            Debug.Log("‚úÖ Box moved off-screen!");
            if (logicScript != null)
            {
                logicScript.addScore(); // Increase score
            }
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}
```
- Gradually Increases Speed
  - ```moveSpeed``` gradually increases over time, making the game progressively harder.
  - ```Mathf.Min(moveSpeed + speedIncrease * Time.deltaTime, maxSpeed);``` prevents the speed from exceeding maxSpeed = 10f
- Moves the box leftward at the current speed. ```transform.position += Vector3.left * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;```
  - ```Time.deltaTime``` ensures smooth movement across different frame rates.
- Detects When the Box Goes Off-Screen
  - If the box moves past ```x = -10f```, it's off the screen and should be destroyed.
  - Before destroying:
    - It logs a message in the console: "‚úÖ Box moved off-screen!"
    - If ```logicScript exists```, it increases the player's score.
    - The box is destroyed to free memory.


### BoxSpawner.cs
The **BoxSpawner.cs** script is responsible for:
- Randomly spawning **floor boxes** and **floating boxes** at set intervals.
- Allowing easy adjustment of spawn positions and heights through the Unity inspector.
- Creating an endless stream of obstacles for the player to avoid.

#### Step 1) Declaring Variables
```
using UnityEngine;

public class BoxSpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Box Prefabs")]
    public GameObject FloorBox;
    public GameObject FloatBox;

    [Header("Spawn Settings")]
    public float spawnRate = 2f;
    private float timer = 0f;

    [Header("Adjustable Spawn Positions")]
    public float floorBoxX = 0f;
    public float floorBoxY = -3f;

    public float floatBoxX = 0f;
    public float minSpawnHeight = 2f;
    public float maxSpawnHeight = 5f;
```
- ```FloorBox``` and ```FloatBox```: Prefabs for obstacles to be spawned, assignable in the Unity inspector.
- ```spawnRate```: Controls how often boxes are spawned (in seconds).
- ```timer```: Keeps track of time between spawns.
- ```floorBoxX``` & ```floorBoxY```: The exact spawn location for floor boxes.
- ```floatBoxX```: X position for floating boxes.
- ```minSpawnHeight``` & ```maxSpawnHeight```: Sets the random height range for spawning floating boxes.

#### Step 2) Handling Spawning Timing in ```Update()``` Method
```
    void Update()
    {
        if (timer < spawnRate)
        {
            timer += Time.deltaTime;
        }
        else
        {
            SpawnBox();
            timer = 0f;
        }
    }
```
- The ```Update()``` method is called once per frame.
- It increments the ```timer``` until it reaches ```spawnRate```.
- Once the timer exceeds the spawn rate, it **spawns a box** and resets the timer.

#### Step 3) Spawning Logic in ```SpawnBox()``` Method
```
    void SpawnBox()
    {
        GameObject boxToSpawn;
        float spawnX, spawnY;

        if (Random.value < 0.5f)
        {
            boxToSpawn = FloorBox;
            spawnX = floorBoxX;
            spawnY = floorBoxY;
        }
        else
        {
            boxToSpawn = FloatBox;
            spawnX = floatBoxX;
            spawnY = Random.Range(minSpawnHeight, maxSpawnHeight);
        }

        Instantiate(boxToSpawn, new Vector3(spawnX, spawnY, 0), Quaternion.identity);
    }
}
```
- **Random Selection**:
  - ```if (Random.value < 0.5f)``` decides whether to spawn a floor box or a float box, giving each a 50% chance.
- **Floor Box Spawn**:
  - Spawns at the defined ```floorBoxX``` and ```floorBoxY``` positions.
- **Float Box Spawn:**
  - Spawns at ```floatBoxX``` with a random height between ```minSpawnHeight``` and ```maxSpawnHeight```.
- ```Instantiate()```:
  - Instantiates the selected box at the calculated position with no rotation (```Quaternion.identity```).

### BoxDestroyer.cs
The **BoxDestroyer.cs** script handles:
- Detecting when obstacles (boxes) leave the game area (usually by crossing a boundary trigger collider).
- Increasing the player‚Äôs score when obstacles are successfully avoided and leave the screen.
- Cleaning up off-screen obstacles to keep the game running smoothly.

#### Step 1) Declaring Variables
```
using UnityEngine;

public class BoxDestroyer : MonoBehaviour
{
    private LogicScript logicScript;
```
- ```LogicScript logicScript;``` ‚Üí Holds a reference to the ```LogicScript``` in order to update the score when obstacles are destroyed.

#### Step 2) Finding LogicScript in ```Start()```
```
    void Start()
    {
        logicScript = GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<LogicScript>();

        if (logicScript == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("‚ùå ERROR: LogicScript NOT found! Make sure 'Logic Manager' is in the scene.");
        }
    }
```
- Uses ```GameObject.FindFirstObjectByType<LogicScript>()``` to **find the Logic Manager in the scene**.
- If not found, an error message appears in the console to alert the developer.

#### Step 3) Handling Object Entry in ```OnTriggerEnter2D()```
```
    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other)
    {
        if (logicScript != null)
        {
            logicScript.addScore(); // Increase score
            Debug.Log("‚úÖ Box entered destroy zone ‚Üí Score should increase.");
        }
        Destroy(other.gameObject);
    }
}
```
- ```OnTriggerEnter2D()``` is called when an obstacle enters the trigger zone (usually an invisible boundary at the edge of the screen).
- If ```logicScript``` **is assigned**, it calls ```addScore()``` to **increase the player‚Äôs score**.
- Logs a message in the console for confirmation.
- Destroys the obstacle (```other.gameObject```) to clean up and free memory.

### LogicScript.cs
The **LogicScript.cs** script handles:
- Tracking and updating the player's **score**.
- Managing the **Game Over screen**.
- Restarting the game when the player chooses to play again.
This script is crucial for displaying UI elements and managing game flow after collisions or successful obstacle avoidance.

#### Step 1) Declaring Variables
```
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class LogicScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int playerScore;
    public Text scoreText;
    public GameObject gameOverScreen;
```
- ```playerScore```: Stores the current player score.
- ```scoreText```: A reference to the UI text object that displays the score.
- ```gameOverScreen```: A reference to the Game Over UI panel, which becomes visible when the player loses.

#### Step 2) Initialization in ```Start()``` Method
```
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("‚úÖ LogicScript has started!");
    }
```
- Logs a message to confirm that the ```LogicScript``` has started and is attached to an active GameObject.

#### Step 3) Increasing the Player's Score (```addScore()``` Method)
```
    [ContextMenu("Increase Score")]
    public void addScore()
    {
        playerScore += 1;
        scoreText.text = playerScore.ToString();
        Debug.Log("‚úÖ Score Increased: " + playerScore);
    }
```
- This method is called to **increase the score by 1** whenever an obstacle leaves the screen without colliding.
- Updates the **score text** in the UI.
- The ```[ContextMenu("Increase Score")]``` attribute allows you to manually test increasing the score from the Unity editor by right-clicking on the script component.

#### Step 4) Restarting the Game (```restartGame()``` Method)
```
    public void restartGame()
    {
        Debug.Log("üîÑ Restarting Game...");
        Time.timeScale = 1f; // ‚úÖ Ensure game resumes before restarting
        SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex);
    }
```
- Resets the game after Game Over.
- ```Time.timeScale = 1f;``` ensures the game is unpaused (in case it was frozen after Game Over).
- **Reloads the current scene** to restart the game from the beginning.


#### Step 5) Handling Game Over (```gameOver()``` Method)
```
    public void gameOver()
    {
        Debug.Log("üíÄ Game Over Screen Activated!");
        if (gameOverScreen != null)
        {
            gameOverScreen.SetActive(true);
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.LogError("‚ùå ERROR: GameOverScreen not assigned in LogicScript!");
        }

        Time.timeScale = 0f; // Pause the game
    }
}
```
- Displays the **Game Over screen** by activating the Game Over UI panel.
- If the ```gameOverScreen``` is not assigned in the inspector, it logs an error.
- **Pauses the game** by setting ```Time.timeScale = 0f;``` so that all physics and movement stop.

## Summary
Once you have completed all the steps, your are finished and have a functional stickman running game!
