## Overview

### Unity Code
When you first create your script for your sprite, there will be two methods loaded in. ```Start()``` is called at the very beginning before the first frame. ```Update``` is called once per frame.
```
using UnityEngine;

public class StickmanScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {

    }

    void Update()
    {

    }
}
```
